Since the inception of the Renewables market, we have been a major player in this field, with our Renewables team being present for every modern innovation in the industry. We are a knowledge sharing partner, with memberships across leading industry organisations such as RenewableUK, we are also part of the NWEA (Netherlands Wind Energy Association). As well as Wind Europe (previously known as 'EWEA'), at the forefront of facilitating the progression and development of European and global markets. More recently, we have developed ties with the Asia Wind Energy Associate and the US Business Network for Offshore Wind.

We have supported over 75 wind farms and 8 substations in Europe; primarily the UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium & Denmark and more recently Taiwan and the United States.

Our teams work across the supply chain, from owners such as Orsted and Vattenfall, to survey contractors like Fugro, turbine manufacturers Siemens Gamesa and MHI Vestas, cable manufacturers NKT, Prysmian and JDR. As well as fleet owners such as Bibby, Boskalis and Van Oord. Currently, we are seeing many of our European clients are transitioning into new markets and we are consequently sharing our knowledge and expertise to help them fulfill their future project pipeline.

In 2019, Atlas opened an office in Boston, our second in the US that will work closely with our Houston team to grow the local US workforce. Next to this, the office is set to form close alliances with trade unions, local academic institutes and maritime academies in the US.

The decision to open an office in Boston is based on the city being a leading Bluetech hub and the growing project pipeline of offshore wind energy in the US, where most of the nearer term activity is concentrated in the Atlantic of the Northeast coast.

IT IS OUR GOAL to provide services and develop win/win business relationships between Offshore Wind Developers and all other stakeholders in the Marine Field. 

We are a company organized by fishermen for fishermen who would like to get involved with and to provide services to the Offshore Wind Industry.

We believe the offshore wind industry will provide a valuable resource for fishing communities who are struggling because of declining fish stocks, increasing regulation and climate change.

Our contacts are vast and our industry knowledge is extensive. It is our intent to become the ""Go To""�company for any services that may be needed by the Offshore Wind Farms.",No,POINT (-80.694413 28.136248)
