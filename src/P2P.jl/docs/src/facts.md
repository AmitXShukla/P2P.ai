# Getting Facts data

In previous chapter, we saw business process operational workflow diagram and also learned high level physical ERDs.

most of the time, Organizations store these datasets in RDBMS tables, document databases and in some case, actual PDFs, images serve as document data itself.

In this chapter, we will use Julia language and Julia packages to mimic Finance & Supply chain data. Majority of this data is **sample data** and **DOES NOT**  bear any resemblance to real life data.

at the same time, I am using lots of actual real life data like UNSPSC codes, GUDID, Vendor, Item master data. Also, These datasets are not specific to any particular ERP systems like SAP, Oracle etc.

However, these sample dataset below are very close to real life data sets and are great assets to learn ERP systems architecture.

!!! note "ERP Data Structure"

    In this chapter, we will read, write and understand typical Finance, Supply chain datasets in Julia language.

    Once we understand these datasets, in following chapters, we will create Graphs, Vertices and Edges for data analysis, load actual data into Graphs.P2P.jl package supports these ERP systems data structures.


let's get started.
