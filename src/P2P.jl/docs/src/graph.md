# Graph Analysis

In previous chapter, we loaded physical ERDs with actual datasets in Julia Dataframes.
I also shared, JuliaLang scripts to export these ERP datasets in csv.

In this chapter, we will create a **complete ERP graph** with vertices, edges and load these datasets into ERP P2P Graph.

let's get started.
