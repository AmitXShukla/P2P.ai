## How did we get here

well.. let's start from the very beginning, 
and I'll try to add some humour, will make silly mistakes, leave out some details and only focus on topics which interests me to come to point quickly.

almost four and half billion years ago, some one created a planet name earth 🌎 or other theory is, perhaps gravity pulled swirling gas 🌀 and dust ☄️ in to become the third planet from the Sun 🌞.

like, I mentioned earlier, let's leave out the details how it was formed and deal with Fact, earth 🌎 is here to stay for quite some more time.

soon, with water, air, fire, sky, earth became home to things which started crawling, swimming, walking and running all over it, let's call these living things species.

Most of these species have one common pattern in behavior. They all eat 🥣, drink 🍷, sleep 🛌 and every time this cycle is broken, some species survive and other die 🪦.

for example, Dinosaurs 🦖, mammoths 🦣 and big foot 🦶🏿 couldn't survive because they cycle was interrupted.
It's not, these species don't fight back with interruptions, they do, and when successful, they survive.
Like cockroaches 🪳, they lived before Dinosaurs 🦖 and still here living healthy.

Most recent latest versions of one such species name human 🧝, has one attribute missing called intelligence 🧐💡 which all other species ever had.

which concludes to my point, let's focus on one such species name human, it's behavior pattern i.e. eat 🥣, drink 🍷, sleep 🛌
and missing attribute called intelligence 🧐💡.

let's visualize these points to paint our big picture.

```@example
# we are using Julia Language for Graph analysis
# TigerGraph provide RESTAPI end points, GSQL and GRAPHSTUDIO to connect TIGERGRAPH
# pyTigerGraph is a Python based library to connect with GRAPH database and run GSQLs
# we will use Julia PyCall package to connect with pyTigerGraph library
#######################################################################
## **perhaps, some day I will re-write pyTigerGraph package in Julia ##
#######################################################################

# open Julia REPL, Jupyter or your favorite Julia IDE, run following

# first import all packages required to support our data analysis
# rest of this chapter assume that below packages are imported once
import Pkg
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
Pkg.add("CSV")
Pkg.add("PyCall")
Pkg.build("PyCall");

# you will also need to install pyTigerGraph in your python environment
# !pip install -U pyTigerGraph
```

!!! info

    before proceeding any further, please setup Tiger Graph Server instance at [tgcloud.io](https://tgcloud.io)
    please don't expect these credentials to work for you, as there is cost involved to keep this.

    hostName = "https://p2p.i.tgcloud.io"

    userName = "tigercloud"

    password = "tigercloud"

    conn = tg.TigerGraphConnection(host=hostName, username=userName, password=password)


---

*now once you have TigerGraph and Julia environments setup, let's jump on to setup sample graph, vertices and edges to get a hang of tools.*

## create graph, vertices and edges

```@example
import Pkg
# you may not need to add conda, pytigergraph
# if you already have python setup
# these instructions are specific for julia setup
Pkg.add("Conda")
ENV["PYTHON"] = "/usr/bin/python3"
using PyCall
using Conda
Conda.pip_interop(true;)
# Conda.pip_interop(true; [env::Environment="/usr/bin/python3"])
Conda.pip("install", "pyTigerGraph")
Conda.add("pyTigerGraph")
tg = pyimport("pyTigerGraph")
# please don't expect below credentials to work for you, and signup at tgcloud
hostName = "https://p2p.i.tgcloud.io"
userName = "tigercloud"
password = "tigercloud"
conn = tg.TigerGraphConnection(host=hostName, username=userName, password=password)

```
