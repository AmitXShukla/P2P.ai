# Business process

let's us learn in detail about everything we already know.

Most of the business's procurement operations are well defined, and for those organizations which don't, better need to prepare one first.
A clear thoughtful defined process to manage Finances and Supply Chain operations are critical not only for organizations even for individuals and families in their day to day life.

## operations workflow
This diagram below shows at very high level, how most of the Procure to Pay operations are performed.

In next chapter, we will read, write and understand these datasets in *Julia language*. 

Once we understand these datasets, in following chapters, we will create **Graphs, Vertices and Edges for data analysis, load actual data into Graphs**. Which will lead us to perform end-to-end supply chain / procure to pay analytics for analysis, predictions and preventions insights.
